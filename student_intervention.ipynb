Since we have used the default values for each model, we can see that the Decision Tree clearly overfits the training data (F1=1). Gaussian naive Bayes classificator performs well both on the training set and the test set as we can judge by the high F1 scores. Nevertheless, since in this case we are not limited by time nor by the size of the dataset, and classifier 3 achieved the largest overall F1 score, I choose Support Vector Machine as the best model for this dataset. Further tuning of the model will be done to find the optimal values of parameters describing  this model. If the dataset were to contain hundreds of thousands of students, this model would not be as suitable and classifier 2 would be a better choice."

    "**Answer: ** The final model chosen for this classification task is a support vector machine (SVM). A SVM is a suppervised learning algorithm used for classification. It is based on the notion of selecting a boundary between the two classes with largest margin. In two dimensions, we can view the margin as the smallest distance between the boundary and the nearest datapoints. By maximalizing the margin, SVMs are very robust to overfitting. The datapoints that lie closest to the decision boundary are called the support vectors. SVM can be used for classification even in case where the categories do not alow for a simple separation. On such sets, the SVM transforms the dataset into a different dataset based on similarities between the datapoints. After the decision boundary has been found, SVM makes the prediction by computing what side of the decision boundary a new datapoint belongs to and classifies it accordingly."
